## Goal
Make a small air hockey table that functions. _(more specific info below)_

## Design

Inspiration:

## Code


## Bill_Of_Materials

#### Materials:
- Wood _(for sides)_
- Acrylic
- 3D print filament _(preferably black for most things)_

#### Specific Components:
- [Computer Fans]([url](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/nmb-technologies-corporation/4710KL-05W-B10-E00/776516)) 
- Rasberry Pi
- LCD or screen in general to keep score _(and possibly show more info, maybe a user interface?)_
- Buttons (reset score button)
- Switch (on/off)
- Distance resistor or photo resistor _(know when someone scores)_
- screws, nuts
- batteries + battery pack

##### (EXTRA) If we have extra time:
- Something for playing sound effects
- GPS (track puck movement)
- PA Buzzer (for sound)
- LED to indicate if the air hockey table is on
- Field Hazards

#### Software, Machinery, & Tools:
- OnShape (or another CAD software)
- 3D Printer
- Laser cutter
- Screwdriver _(drill maybe or something similar if we need it)_


## What_Do_We_Need_To_Know_For_This_Project?
- Air mechanics, equations, and anything related to that and making something float.
- Keeping track of people scoring. _(How might we go about that?)_


## How_Will_The_Final_Product_Function?
Someone will cut on the air hockey table and be able to play a full game (two people), or if they choose to, reset the score with the push of a button. _(this feature relies on trust, someone could be a bad-sport and reset the score. However, not having this feature is dumb as people would have to cut the machine off and on again to reset the score.)_ The score will be tracked from an LCD or a similar display/screen. 

Success is the functionality above working, and, not breaking.

## What_Can_Go_Wrong?
- the score counter not working
- the reset score button breaking, resetting a score mid-game.
- too much power consumtion _(batteries could also run out.)_
- the puck not float
- a goal not getting registered

## Schedule:

#### December:
1. Project proposal
2. Basic code system for Air Hockey Table and get it working, slightly
3. Basic CAD work, makiing air hockey table, prototyping hole sizes.

If we got more time:
4. Work on a protoype and get it somewhat functional

#### January: Initial CAD + Code
1. more refined code system for Air Hockey Table and get it working.
2. more refined CAD work, makiing air hockey table, getting closer to final product.

If we got more time:
4. Work on a protoype and get it somewhat or mostly functional

#### February: Functional Prototype Creation
if we haven't done it already, wrk on a protoype and get it mostly/entirely functional.

If we have time:
- Begin/continue process for making final design

#### March: Design Refinement + Final Tweaks
- Begin/continue process for making final design

#### April: Launches + Data collection
- continue/end process for making final air hockey table

#### May: Analize Data + Finalize Documentation
If we haven't yet, finish the final version of the air hockey table.

#### June: Emergency Project Work + Drones
If we haven't yet, finish the final version of the air hockey table.
