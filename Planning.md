## Goal
Make a small air hockey table that functions. _(more specific info below)_

## Design

Inspiration:

## Code


## Bill_Of_Materials

#### Materials:
- Wood _(for sides)_
- Acrylic
- 3D print filament _(preferably black for most things)_

#### Specific Components:
- Computer Fans
- Rasberry Pi
- LCD or screen in general to keep score _(and possibly show more info, maybe a user interface?)_
- Buttons (reset score button)
- Switch (on/off)
- Distance resistor or photo resistor _(know when someone scores)_
- screws, nuts
- batteries + battery pack

##### (EXTRA) If we have extra time:
- Something for playing sound effects
- GPS (track puck movement)
- PA Buzzer (for sound)
- LED to indicate if the air hockey table is on

#### Software, Machinery, & Tools:
- OnShape (or another CAD software)
- 3D Printer
- Laser cutter
- Screwdriver _(drill maybe or something similar if we need it)_


## What_Do_We_Need_To_Know_For_This_Project?
- Air mechanics, equations, and anything related to that and making something float.
- Keeping track of people scoring. _(How might we go about that?)_


## How_Will_The_Final_Product_Function?
Someone will cut on the air hockey table and be able to play a full game (two people), or if they choose to, reset the score with the push of a button. _(this feature relies on trust, someone could be a bad-sport and reset the score. However, not having this feature is dumb as people would have to cut the machine off and on again to reset the score.)_ The score will be tracked from an LCD or a similar display/screen. 

Success is the functionality above working, and, not breaking.

## What_Can_Go_Wrong?
- the score counter not working
- the reset score button breaking, resetting a score mid-game.
- too much power consumtion _(batteries could also run out.)_
- the puck not float
- a goal not getting registered
